How it Works:

Input: Users upload an image containing food items using the sidebar file uploader.

Analysis: The application extracts visual features from the uploaded image using a deep learning model.

Classification: The extracted features are processed through a trained classifier, which predicts the category of food in the image.

Output: The predicted food category is displayed alongside the uploaded image, providing instant classification results.

Key Features:

Efficient Classification: Utilizes image embeddings for accurate food category prediction.
User-friendly Interface: Simple file upload interface with real-time classification feedback.
Scalable: Handles image uploads up to 5MB in size for comprehensive food image analysis.
Try it Out:

Upload: Select an image file containing food items.
Predict: Click the "Predict Category" button to see the predicted food category.
Explore: Explore various food images and see how accurately they are classified!
